# Affordibility Web Application

## Goal
With costs on the rise and housing through the rough, I wanted to aggregate data across many industry different sectors to calculate an affordibility factor. This factor would be visualized in a fun and interactive way for users to run off-shoot analytics and browse various trends people across the US are dealing with.

## Tech Stack
Django Web Framework
Python3
HTML/CSS/js
D3.js

Deployment Infra: TBD

## On going...
